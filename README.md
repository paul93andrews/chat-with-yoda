# Chat with Yoda

I've always sought the kind of advice a Jedi Master could provide. So I created a chat bot that does just that. It uses React and adheres to responsive design and accessibility principles. The app also uses Firebase to persist chat history and enable authentication. 

As a massive Star Wars geek, this was incredibly fun and rewarding to put together. It was also very challenging. I aimed high for my first project in React. I wanted to enable authentication to give users a real chat experience with a Yoda bot. It proved difficult and after one week the first iteration of this app was not what I expected. However, I returned to it over the course of a few days and made this one of my finest apps. I'm proud of the grit I showed and the work I created here.
